### Catherine Lee Brockway, PhD

I'm currently working on:
1. Developing and teaching a series of UNITAR short courses on GIS for Sustainability and Resilience.
2. Developing the LanguageFinder web app which makes language data accessible for social sector decision-making around language access.
3. Consulting on various new GIS programs at higher ed institutions across the Pacific.
