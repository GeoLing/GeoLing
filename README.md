### Catherine Lee Brockway, PhD

I'm currently working on:
1. Identifying key data science vocabulary to understand data science textbooks.
2. Measuring the linguistic accessibility of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
3. Providing subject matter expertise for an app that makes language data from the American Community Survey more easily accessible.
